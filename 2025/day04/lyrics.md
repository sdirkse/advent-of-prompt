[Verse]
Dr. Dull’s got his clipboard tight
Checking off boxes
No joy in sight
His office glows with fluorescent white
He banned the sparkle
He dimmed the light

[Chorus]
But Hugo the Hedgehog’s got a plan
With a wiggle and a jiggle and a festive jam
He’ll prompt the cheer
He’ll take a stand
Dr. Dull won’t know where to land

[Verse 2]
Hugo’s got prompts
They’re shiny and bold
“Think of tinsel
Think of gold!”
“Picture laughter
Warm and loud
Imagine snowflakes
A bustling crowd”

[Prechorus]
Dr. Dull sneers
“This won’t do!”
But Hugo grins
“Oh
We’ll see it through”

[Chorus]
‘Cause Hugo the Hedgehog’s got a plan
With a wiggle and a jiggle and a festive jam
He’ll prompt the cheer
He’ll take a stand
Dr. Dull won’t know where to land

[Bridge]
He wrote on the walls with candy cane ink
“Now think of cocoa
Just stop and think”
He drew a sleigh
He drew the stars
He even strung lights on Dr. Dull’s car

[Verse]
Snowflakes fallin' down
Hugo sleeps so sound
Dreamin' of the lights
Sparklin' through the nights

[Pre-Chorus]
Tiny nose twitches quick
Somethin' sweet and slick

[Chorus]
Oh Hugo Hugo hedgehog friend
Christmas magic never ends
Oh Hugo Hugo little star
Shining bright no matter how far

[Verse 2]
Candy canes so red
Dancin' in his head
Stockings on the wall
Waiting for a call

[Pre-Chorus]
Little paws a-tap
Ready for a nap

[Chorus]
Oh Hugo Hugo hedgehog friend
Christmas magic never ends
Oh Hugo Hugo little star
Shining bright no matter how far

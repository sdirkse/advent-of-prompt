A Christmas Poem for Santa

When the days grow short and the cold winds blow,
There’s a warmth in my home that continues to glow.
It sparkles like snow in the soft winter night—
A comfort that fills every moment with light.

It grows even brighter with each joyful grin
From two little hearts full of wonder within.
Their giggles and magic make spirits soar high,
Like wishing-star sparks drifting up through the sky.

Each moment with them is a gift wrapped in gold,
A story of love that is precious to hold.
When darkness creeps in and the world feels less bright,
They’re lanterns that guide me with gentle, sweet light.

So Santa, dear friend, in this season of cheer,
I cherish these treasures more each passing year.
With love all around, winter turns into bliss—
A season of warmth, wrapped in joy’s tender kiss.

**A Christmas Poem for x**

When the days grow short and the cold winds blow,
There’s a light in my heart that continues to glow.
It shines through the frost and the long winter night—
It’s you, dearest x, my joy and my light.

And brighter it grows with each laugh that begins
From our wonderful z and our bold-hearted y.
Their giggles and wonder make spirits soar high,
Like stars that wake early to dance in the sky.

Each moment with you is a gift wrapped in gold,
A story of love that’s forever retold.
When darkness creeps in and the world feels less bright,
You three are my lanterns—my warmth and my light.

So here in this season of candles and cheer,
I cherish you more with each day of the year.
x, my love, with y and sweet z—
You turn winter’s chill into pure happiness.

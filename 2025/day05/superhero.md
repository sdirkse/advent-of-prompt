# Luminor, the Radiant Catalyst

Luminor is a superhero whose very existence defies monotony. His power is the ability to absorb dullness in any form—emotional heaviness, creative stagnation, lifeless environments, even metaphorical “grayness”—and convert it into radiant energy. This energy manifests as light, color, inspiration, vitality, or even emotional uplift in the people around him.

He doesn’t simply remove dullness; he transmutes it into beauty.

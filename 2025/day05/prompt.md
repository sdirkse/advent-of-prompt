I want to create a superhero that has the power to defeat dullness. His superpower is turning dullness into radiance. The more dullness around him, the more powerful he becomes. It would seem that he would want everything to be dull, but he has an innate drive to create a radiant world around him.

Superhero: Luminor, the Radiant Catalyst
Luminor is a superhero whose very existence defies monotony. His power is the ability to absorb dullness in any form—emotional heaviness, creative stagnation, lifeless environments, even metaphorical “grayness”—and convert it into radiant energy. This energy manifests as light, color, inspiration, vitality, or even emotional uplift in the people around him.

He doesn’t simply remove dullness; he transmutes it into beauty.
